# Arctyk Community

Welcome to the **Arctyk Community** 👋  
This repository is the central hub for discussions, ideas, and collaboration around the **Arctyk ITSM platform** and its modular apps.

## 🚀 About Arctyk ITSM
Arctyk ITSM is a **modular, open IT Service Management platform** designed for IT departments of all sizes.  
It provides flexible apps such as:
- 🎫 **Tickets (Core Helpdesk)**
- 📦 **Inventory & Asset Management**
- 📊 **Reports & Metrics**
- 🛠️ **Projects & Tasks**
- ⚙️ **Integrations (Zendesk, Jira, and more)**

The platform is built with **Django**, is fully open source, and emphasizes modularity so features can be added or removed without affecting the core.
